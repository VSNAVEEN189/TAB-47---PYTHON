'''Leap Year Logic
You'll practice
Boolean logic with operators only — no if/else
A year is a leap year if:
• it is divisible by 4, AND
• it is NOT divisible by 100, UNLESS it is also divisible by 400.

Take a year from the user. WITHOUT using if/else, 
print each individual condition's boolean result,
then the final combined answer built purely from boolean operators (and / or / not).
'''

year = int(input("Enter year: "))

divisible_by_4 = year % 4 == 0
divisible_by_100 = year % 100 == 0
divisible_by_400 = year % 400 == 0

is_leap_year = divisible_by_4 and (not divisible_by_100 or divisible_by_400)

print(f"Divisible by 4:   {divisible_by_4}")
print(f"Divisible by 100: {divisible_by_100}")
print(f"Divisible by 400: {divisible_by_400}")
print(f"Is leap year:     {is_leap_year}")
